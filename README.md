### 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis with NumPy
I developed a Python project using **NumPy** to analyze a year’s worth of daily temperature data (365 days). Key features include:
- **Dataset Generation**: Created a reproducible dataset of days, minimum temperatures (-10°C to 15°C), and maximum temperatures (5°C to 35°C) using `np.random.seed(42)`.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computed average min/max temperatures, identified the highest and lowest temperatures with their corresponding days.
- **Daily Range Calculation**: Calculated daily temperature ranges and found the day with the largest range.
- **Heatwave Detection**: Identified heatwaves (3+ consecutive days above 30°C) using efficient NumPy operations.
- **Code**: Check out the project [here](https://github.com/Moksel-arch/weather-data-numpy) to explore the code and results!
This project showcases my ability to handle time-series data, a skill I’m applying to cybersecurity analytics, such as detecting anomalies in network traffic.
